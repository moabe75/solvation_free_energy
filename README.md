**Project Discription**

In this project the aim is to develop machine (ML) learning models to predict the solvation free energy of small drug molecules. The ML models are trained on a data set obtained from high level DFT calculations.  
1) The "molecules_ChEMBL.sdf" file contains 2586 small neutral drug molecules with 1 aromatic ring and molecular weight less than 150, taken from ChEMBL database.
